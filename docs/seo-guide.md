## SEO Implementation Overview

The LocalizeStrings.com website has been optimized for search engines with the following key components:

- Enhanced metadata with descriptive titles and descriptions
- Structured data using Schema.org markup
- Sitemap.xml and robots.txt files
- Breadcrumb navigation with structured data
- Social media preview images
- Page-specific metadata for key pages

## Metadata Management

### Global Metadata

The global metadata is defined in `src/app/metadata.js`. This file contains the default metadata for the entire site, including:

- Title
- Description
- Keywords
- Open Graph metadata
- Twitter card metadata
- Robots directives
- Canonical URL

### Page-Specific Metadata

For individual pages, we use the `PageMetadata` component located at `src/app/components/PageMetadata.js`. This component allows you to set page-specific metadata, including:

- Title
- Description
- Keywords
- Canonical URL
- Open Graph image
- Open Graph type

To add page-specific metadata to a page, import the component and use it at the top level of your page component:

```jsx
import PageMetadata from '../components/PageMetadata';

export default function YourPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <PageMetadata 
        title="Your Page Title"
        description="Your page description"
        keywords="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"
        canonicalPath="/your-page-path"
      />
      {/* Rest of your component */}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Sitemap and Robots.txt

### Sitemap

The sitemap is automatically generated using the script at `scripts/generate-sitemap.js`. This script scans the `src/app` directory for page components and generates a sitemap.xml file in the public directory.

To manually regenerate the sitemap, run:

```bash
npm run generate-sitemap
```

The sitemap is also automatically generated before each build via the `prebuild` script.

### Robots.txt

The robots.txt file is located at `public/robots.txt`. It allows all web crawlers to access the site and disallows access to private areas like login and signup pages.

## Structured Data

Structured data is implemented using Schema.org markup to help search engines understand the content of the website.

### Global Structured Data

The global structured data is defined in the `SchemaMarkup` component at `src/app/components/SchemaMarkup.js`. This component adds the following structured data to all pages:

- WebSite schema
- Organization schema
- SoftwareApplication schema

### Breadcrumb Structured Data

The breadcrumb navigation includes structured data defined in the `Breadcrumbs` component at `src/app/components/Breadcrumbs.js`. This helps search engines understand the hierarchical structure of the website.

## Social Media Integration

### Open Graph and Twitter Cards

Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata are included in both the global metadata and page-specific metadata. This ensures that when links to the website are shared on social media, they display with appropriate titles, descriptions, and images.

### Social Media Preview Images

Social media preview images are generated using the script at `scripts/generate-og-images.js`. This script creates optimized images for sharing on social media platforms.

To manually regenerate the social media preview images, run:

```bash
npm run generate-og-images
```

## Content Optimization

### Keyword Strategy

Focus on the following primary keywords:

- XLIFF translator
- JSON translator
- localization tool
- translation software
- multilingual support
- file translation

Secondary keywords:

- online translator
- file translator
- validator
- language translation
- localization workflow

### Content Guidelines

When creating or updating content, follow these guidelines:

1. Include primary keywords in titles, headings, and the first paragraph
2. Use secondary keywords naturally throughout the content
3. Ensure content is valuable, informative, and addresses user needs
4. Include internal links to related pages
5. Use descriptive alt text for images
6. Structure content with appropriate headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)

## Performance Optimization

1. Optimized images with appropriate dimensions and formats
2. Efficient code splitting and lazy loading
3. Minimized CSS and JavaScript
4. Responsive design for mobile optimization

## Monitoring and Analytics
